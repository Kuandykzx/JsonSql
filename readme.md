# The goal

If you don't like XPath-like syntax of libraries similar to [JsonPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) or find Circe too stiff for you needs, then this library is for you (or is it?  :smirk: ).
The goal here is to enable Scala programmers to execute SQL-like queries against JSON data. This comes with a promise I made to myself, saying that the code should be written with a functional mindset,
therefore I'm not throwing exceptions anywhere and using monads everywhere. It's still early alpha, but I'm trying to add more and more functionalities every day.

PS. yep, I know there are libraries like this one already. Maybe I'll do the same thing worse or maybe better than the authors of the other libs, 
but anyhow I plan to have a lot of fun while working on this piece of code!
