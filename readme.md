# The goal

If you don't like XPath-like syntax of libraries similar to [JsonPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) or find Circe too stiff for you needs, then this library is for you (or is it?  :smirk: ).
The goal here is to enable Scala programmers to execute SQL-like queries agains JSON data. This is still early alpha, but I'll be adding some documentation as I go.
